Tests ran on initial version with all LJ-atoms interacting. Tested for different compilers with different optimization settings on the "add_timer" branch

TEST1 initial test

with g++:

g++ -o main main.cpp
initializing atoms took 3787microseconds
Calculation took 4525ms

g++ -O3 -o main main.cpp
initializing atoms took 1326microseconds
Calculation took 1245ms

with Clang++

clang++ -o main main.cpp
initializing atoms took 8990microseconds
Calculation took 4438ms

clang++ -O3 -o main main.cpp
initializing atoms took 5459microseconds
Calculation took 1086ms



Conclusions:

G++ initializes the array of atoms faster than c-lang even when g++ is used without optimization and c-lang with.
Clang performs the  main calculations faster.
-O3 optimization gives clear significant performance gains.
